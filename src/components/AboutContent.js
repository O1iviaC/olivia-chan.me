            <h1> Meet Olivia</h1>
            <p> How's it going? ðŸ‘‹ I am a student at the University of Waterloo and
                Wilfrid Laurier University pursuing a double-degree in Computer Science
                and Business Administration. My ultimate career goal is to leverage my
                business knowledge to create technological solutions that make a positive social impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that businesses give technology purpose but also that technology helps to make great
                businesses. So whether it's in a developer, consulting, or management capacity I believe my skills
                can help take any business or their technology to the next level!
